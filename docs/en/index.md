## Description Minecraft

**Minecraft** is a cubic game that is both a _construction_ and an _adventure_ game.  
So there are two possibilities:

- The **"survival"** mode, which consists of progressing through the game by exploring the four corners of the world and acquiring "crafts" (an interface where you can make objects with the resources you have, from a crafting table) which allows you to have all the resources in the game.  

- The **"creative"** mode, which as it says is where you can create a sort of sandbox that allows you to make all sorts of creations and thus bring out all your imagination. 

> Two main versions of the game:
>
>   - Minecraft Java Edition
>   - Minecraft Bedrock
     
!!! info "Minecraft modes"
    Minecraft consists of two modes, one is _Solo_ mode where the person creates their world and has to survive or build. And then we have the _Multiplayer_ [^multi] mode which is the principle of playing with players online.  
    You just have to connect to online "servers" of players where there are worlds created by other players. And indeed in these servers we can find mini-games such as "_Bedwars_" or "_Skyblock_" !

    ![Interface accueil Minecraft](../images/interface_accueil_minecraft.png "Minecraft home interface"){ width=350 }
    [^multi]: This mode is free and easy to access, for more info: [Click here](multijoueurs_infos.md)
     
    !!! faq "What is the Skyblock ?" 
        -The skyblock from where its name in English "sky" and "block". Indeed, the principle is to build an island in an open world in the sky from "blocks" where you can set all sorts of goals such as building decorations, being the richest and building all sorts of farms/machines to exploit other resources to set your goals.
!!! faq "Infinite Water and Lava ?"
    To get water ![Water](../images/sources/eau.webp "Water"){ width=30 } to infinity you only need to put water in a hole of `2x2`, two buckets of water  ![buckets of water](../images/items/seau_eau.webp "buckets of water"){ width=30 } at both ends of the diagonals.  
    This can also work via a glass that has been broken only after being placed at the ends of the hole.

    ![infinite Water](../images/sources/eau_infini.png "infinite Water"){ width=250 }

    To get lava ![Lava](../images/sources/lave.webp "Lava"){ width=30 } to infinity initially concerns players playing from version 1.17 onwards, as the game saw the stalactics for the first time ![Stalactics](../images/blocs/stalactique.webp "Stalactics"){ width=30 } that have allowed a revolution on the problem of having lava in the overworld.  
    All you need is a lava source, a stalactic block and a cauldron ![Cauldron](../images/blocs/chaudron.webp "Cauldron"){ width=30 } (seven iron ingots are needed ![Iron ingot](../images/items/lingot-de-fer.webp "Iron ingot"){ width=30 } to be able to craft a cauldron).

    ![infinite Lava](../images/sources/lave_infini.avif "infinite Lava"){ width=250 }

I want to say that this skyblock tutorial is mainly for the Java version.  
In addition, I'm focusing more on the topic of farms/machines for your skyblock survival which will allow you to acquire several resources including the main ones like iron, monster loot, and cobblestone/stone.

    
        
## Minerals/farms to acquire as soon as possible to get started :

!!! info "Farms that know how to do it :"
    Each of the farms are either Auto[^ip] or Semi-Auto[^Semi-Auto].
    
    | entities | Farm |  Semi-Auto | Auto |
    |----------|--------|:----------:|:----:|
    | Stone/cobblestone | Stone/cobblestone Farm | ✅ | ⭕ |
    | Loot of mobs | Mobs farm | ⭕ | ✅ |
    | Iron ingot | Iron farm | ⭕ | ✅ |
    | Wood logs | Wood farm | ✅ | ⭕ |
    | Pnj | Pnj farm | ✅ | ⭕ |

You will notice the word "**entities**" which corresponds to all items (objets) or mobs (monsters, animals, villagers, and even the players), for more information :[click here](entites_minecraft.md)
[^ip]: Automatic, so the farm in question does not need any assistance from the player.
[^Semi-Auto]: Semi-Automatic, so the farm in question needs assistance from the player.

## List of some farms/machines :

### Block-building farms/machines to expand your island :

??? info "Building the farms/machines"
    For each farm or machine, if you find one you like or would like to try, just click on the image and it will take you to a video where I show you how to do it using a mod called "Latematica" (formerly called Shematica) or from an explanatory youtube video.



!!! info "Stone/cobblestone farms"
    To start a Skyblock you first need blocks to enlarge your island.  
    To do this we have the cobblestone machine/farm ![Block of cobblestone](../images/blocs/cobblestone.png "Block of cobblestone"){ width=30 } or the one at stone ![Block of stone](../images/blocs/stone.png "Block of stone"){ width=30 } , there are several :
    
    === "The basic cobblestone farm :"
        - Fast and efficient at the beginning of the game but quickly becomes cumbersome and long to break. 
         
        - In the video below, I put tiles on top of the lava because otherwise the lava might ignite objects around it, such as craft tables or other wooden objects.
    
        - It is best to dig a hole underneath you while you break the cobblestone to mine in the void and not destroy any blocks behind the generated cobblestone.

        [![example of a cobblestone farm](../images/machines/ferme_%C3%A0_cobblestone.png "example of a cobblestone farm")](video/ferme_à_cobblestone.mp4)   

    === "Another stone/cobblestone farm :" 
        - Not very long to do and does not require a lot of resources:

    === "The stone farm in column :"
        - Requires more redstone mechanics but with the directions you can get away with it.

    ???+ danger "Another stone/cobblestone farm "     
        You will be able to find a **huge** and very **complex** stone/cobblestone farm, note that this is only required for those who do not have two left feet with redstone.

### Mineral farms/machines :

!!! info "Iron farms"
    In a Skyblock you will need a lot of iron at one time or another, for this there are Iron Farms, the principle is simple, Mojang (those who take care of the game Minecraft) have made a system when pnjs[^pnj] ![ Pnj ](../images/Créatures/Passifs/villageois.webp "Villagers"){ width=30 }are with beds it forms a village and then there will appear an iron golem ![Iron golem](../images/Créatures/Neutres/golem_de_fer.webp "Iron golem"){ width=30 }. This iron golem if killed will drop iron ![Iron ingot](../images/items/lingot-de-fer.webp "Iron ingot"){ width=30 } on the ground and a poppy ![Poppy](../images/items/coquelicot.webp "Poppy"){ width=30 }.

!!! info "Gold farms "
    Gold can be used for many things: for your personal desire to be rich and feel like a real pirate with your treasure, but more concretely for your tools and armour even if it's not the best material in terms of life but it's rather efficient on a short term.  
    
    Then you can make the food golden to better saturate your food bar ![Food bar](../images/Barre_de_nourriture.webp "Food bar"){ width=120 } :  
    The golden carrots which are very useful for saturating your food bar or the well known golden apples which can give you _Regeneration_ II (0:05) and _Absorption_ (2:00) which are very effective in combat.  
    Of course this is not all but the rest of the items to craft with gold are less used. 
    
    !!! faq "How a gold farm works ?"
        The principle of this farm is simple: you have to put nether portals to make piglins [^pigmens] appear which fall when a snowman shoots one of his compatriots ( or in the new versions of the game there are turtle eggs).  
        This forces him to intervene and he falls into a stream of water and then falls into a hole that is meant for him to fall into.  
        
        All you have to do is put in funnels ![Funnel](../images/blocs/entonnoir.webp "Funnel"){ width=30 } connect to safes ![Chest](../images/blocs/coffre.webp "Chest"){ width=30 } to retrieve his booty: gold nuggets ![Gold nugget](../images/items/pepite_or.webp "Gold nugget"){ width=30 } , sometimes gold bars ![Gold ingot](../images/items/lingot_or.webp "Gold ingot"){ width=30 } , his putrified flesh ![Putrified flesh](../images/items/chair_putrifie.webp "Putrified flesh"){ width=30 } and a golden sword ![A golden sword](../images/items/epee_or.webp "A golden sword"){ width=30 } (these items are random when collecting loot).
        [^pigmens]: Formerly called "pigmens" if you are not familiar with this creature take a look [Here](entites_minecraft.md)

    Let me introduce you to a French youtuber Aurelien_Sama ![Youtuber Aurelien_Sama ](../images/Aurelien_Sama.jpg "Youtuber Aurelien_Sama "){ width=30 } who does a lot of content on Minecraft including news on game updates, farms/machines etc.  
    I'm putting below one of his gold farms:
    
    <iframe width="800" height="562" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ug8TOAt0i8I" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    !!! note "Notch's apple "
        Notch's apple ![Notch's apple](../images/items/pomme_de_notch.webp "Notch's apple"){ width=30 } is the nickname of the enchanted golden apple from the creator of Minecraft. Notch's apple is not craftable but it is possible to find it in Dungeons, Manors, Ruined Portals of the nether, Abandoned Mines, Desert Temples and Bastion Remains.  
        
        However it was possible to make it in version 1.9 with eight gold blocks, the gold farms were more than beneficial to have these enchanted golden apples that's why I'm talking about it here.

    !!! tip "What is xp ?"
        The xp, whose full name is "experience", comes in the form of small balls of green particles ![Xp](../images/xp.webp "Experience"){ width=30 }. It is obtained when the player kills a creature with any tools or by cooking objects in an oven ![Furnace](../images/blocs/four.webp "Furnace"){ width=30 } and finally by farms like the gold farm.  
        
        Experience is consumed very quickly as it is used to enchant your tools, armour and also to repair them, hence the need to have a farm that gives you experience.
    !!! danger "Complex gold farm"
        You can have much more complex gold farms like for example a farm of the youtuber Ilmango ![Youtuber Ilmango](../images/ilmango.png "Youtuber Ilmango"){ width=30 } but this concerns players who play a version lower than 1.14 of Minecraft because a bug on the rage of the piglins on the player has been fixed.[Click here](listes_fermes_avancees.md)  
        I advise you to have a look at it because the youtuber does not stop at version 1.14.
